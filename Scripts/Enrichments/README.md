# Computing Enrichments
Note: all of these scripts rely on Scripts/Enrichments/enrichment_functions.R

### compute_enrichments_medz 
Calculate relative risk of rare variants nearby outliers  
Collect features for outliers and controls and assess feature enrichment in outliers vs. controls.   
Saves the outliers and enrichments in an RData file    
Generates relative risk of rare variants nearby outliers as compared to controls in the given window, in data_v8/outliers/   
  - output: outfolder/data_v8/outliers/enrichments_10kb_genebody_Z3.RData     
  - scripts: Scripts/Enrichments/compute_enrichments_MEDZ.R
