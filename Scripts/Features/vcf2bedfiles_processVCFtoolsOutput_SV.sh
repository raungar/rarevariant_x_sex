# PROCESS ALLELE FREQUENCY FILE

# for SNPs: columns 6 onwards are the alleles in order presented in the vcf with "." for columns up to 10 (ATCG*) if no extra alleles
# if there are multiple non reference alleles, the non-ref AF is set to 1-ref AF
# skips chrom X
# Doesn't remove X and af=-nan for HallLab SV because there are duplicate entries for the same coordinate and that needs to be dealt with separately

# PROCESS GENOTYPE FILE
# do each column separately
# extract individual information from sample name
# get bed file of genotypes (in 0,1,2 format) and intersect with AF
# filter to keep heterozygotes and the minor allele homozygotes
# output bedfile with AF and genotype as columns 4 and 5

# deals with SVs entirely differently (takes care of AF filtering at this step)
# this is because there are duplicate entries for the same positions, so can't use a bed intersect
# probably could have dealt with SNPs and indels in a similar way, but keeping them as is because it already works.
